        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Peter Parker is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Holland in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise–based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—also known by his alias, Spider-Man. Parker is initially depicted as a student at the Midtown School of Science and Technology who received spider-like and superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Parker initially uses his powers to fight crime as a vigilante in Queens.

            Parker is approached by Tony Stark, who mentors him and eventually recruits him into the Avengers during the conflict against Thanos. Following the Blip and Stark's death, Parker encounters Quentin Beck while on a school trip; Beck frames Parker for his murder and reveals his identity to the world, prompting Parker to seek Stephen Strange's help to reverse this. Strange's spell causes the multiverse to fracture, bringing in alternate versions of Spider-Man and their enemies. In order to repair the damage, Strange casts a spell that permanently erases the world's shared knowledge of Parker's civilian persona, including his relationships with his loved ones, friends, and other superhero allies.
            
            Holland's version of the character is the successor to the Peter Parker portrayed by Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002–2007) and the Peter Parker portrayed by Andrew Garfield in Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man duology (2012–2014), both of whom reprise their roles and appear in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). To distinguish himself from the other versions, he is referred to by the other Parkers as "Peter-One". Holland has received praise and several accolades for his portrayal of the character.
            
            Parker is a central character in the MCU, appearing in six films as of 2023. A fourth Spider-Man film is in development, with Holland reprising his role. Alternate versions of Parker appear in the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021–present) and Spider-Man: Freshman Year (2024), voiced by Hudson Thames.</p>

            <li>The Homemade suit is a suit developed by Peter Parker during his early months as Spider-Man.

            <li>The Homecoming suit was a suit developed by Tony Stark for Parker, described as an upgrade to the Homemade one. It first appears as Parker's primary suit in Civil War and Homecoming, Parker ceases to use it in Avengers: Infinity War, and the suit is blown up in Spider-Man: Far From Home.
